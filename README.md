# SPriBHoS
Python code based on spectral methods to solve the gravitational collapse of spherically symmetric super-horizon fluctuations, leading to Primordial Black Hole formation. 

The code is the one created and used in the work: A. Escriv√†. Phys.Dark Univ. 27 (2020) 100466. Arxiv:1907.13065.

The code was realised publicly the same day that Arxiv:1907.13065 appeared publicly on the following website:
https://sites.google.com/fqa.ub.edu/albertescriva/home.

The code has now been transferred to GitHub for practical purposes and updates.
